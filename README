Krb4 provides an object oriented interface to several functions in the 
Kerberos 4 API.  It is compatible with both AFS and MIT Kerberos.

This is a beta release of Krb4.  Please let me know of any problems or
suggestions by sending e-mail to jhorwitz@umich.edu.

The latest version of Krb4 can be obtained from CPAN.


REQUIREMENTS
------------
The Kerberos 4 libraries (libkrb.a, libdes.a) and include files must be 
installed on the host on which you are building.


BUILDING & INSTALLATION
-----------------------
Compilation may be noisy, but everything should compile just fine.  I'll 
work on fixing this.

Four easy steps:
1) edit Makefile.PL, and change LIBS and INC to reflect the paths to your
   Kerberos libraries and include files, respectively.  Add any other
   customizations you might need.
2) perl Makefile.PL
3) make
4) make install


DOCUMENTATION
-------------
Pod documentation is supplied in Krb4.pm.  'make install' should generate
a man page for you.  The documentation is not extensive, and assumes 
familiarity with Kerberos.
